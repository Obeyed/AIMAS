%\emph{How does your client work? Describe its overall algorithmic functionality as clearly and precisely as possible, without going into any implementation details.  Describe it in terms of the theories you rely on (as presented in background). Include small, illustrative examples of how the client works. Aim to describe your client suffi- ciently precisely that a reader being an expert in the field would be able to implement a similar solution based on your description (note that this is not an encouragement to describe implementation details, but rather make sure that the overall structure and ideas of your implementation are sufficiently precise).}

This section describes our client's overall algorithmic functionality.
The client is comprised of our goal prioritisation technique (\cref{methods:goal_ordering}), the level representation (\cref{sec:representing a level}), the path finding algorithm (\cref{sec:constructing paths and searching}), and the overall planner (\cref{sec:planning on the fly}).
The client receives an incomplete plan from the planner, where the client makes sure to update the plan with the necessary \texttt{NoOp} operations for waiting agents.

Before we begin describing the client's overall functionality, we will give an intuition of how the planner works.
Consider the scenario presented in \cref{fig:intuition example}.
The red agent \textbf{0} must move the red box \textbf{A} to the goal.
Multiple boxes are in the way of the desired plan.
The state of the level in the figure is that the cyan agent \textbf{1} has moved its box out of the way, and so has the yellow agent \textbf{2}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]

  \caption{\label{fig:intuition example}The red agent \textbf{0} must move box \textbf{A} to the goal \textbf{a}.}
\end{figure}

However, the yellow agent \textbf{2} is now itself in the way of the path.
The planner thus informs that agent to move out of the desired path.
The client will continue to detect obstacles in the desired plan and move them until no more obstacles are in the way.
Then the red agent \textbf{0} will move the red box \textbf{A} to the goal.

\subsection{Goal Prioritisation Technique}
\label{methods:goal_ordering}

In order to explain how the functionality of our prioritisation works, we will break it down into three separate steps. For all the three steps we use an example set of goal cells, which are all only accessible form a single entrance.

% Example of cells
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.5\columnwidth]{graphics/ie_level.png}
  \caption{\label{fig:sample}Goal set with single entrance.}
\end{figure}

For the example in \cref{fig:sample} the optimal ordering would be to fulfil the goals in the following order: \textbf{a, c, b, e, f}, respectively.
To accomplish this, our algorithm provides an ordering score to each goal.

\subsubsection{Evaluating Each Goals Neighbouring Cells}

First, the algorithm evaluates each goal's eight neighbouring cells (including the diagonal neighbours) by giving them a score each.
For every neighbouring goal-cell, the score is incremented by 1.
For every free neighbour cell, the score is incremented by 2.
The checking of neighbouring cells is illustrated with a grid in \cref{fig:grid1}.
The middle cell is the one currently being checked, while the green represents a neighbour goal.
A red cell represents an unreachable position (either a wall or out of bounds).

% Example of scoring
\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.5\columnwidth]{graphics/goal_pri_1.png}
  \caption{\label{fig:grid1}Neighbour checking of goal \textbf{a}.}
\end{figure}

The goal \textbf{a} is given a start score of 1.
Goal \textbf{f} and \textbf{b} are given scores of respectively 3 and 2 as can be seen in \cref{fig:grid2}.
A blue cell in the grid represents a free neighbour, while a green cell represents a neighbouring goal.
The remaining goals not shown in the figures are all given a score of 2.

  \includegraphics[width=.5\columnwidth]{graphics/goal_pri_2.png}
  \caption{\label{fig:grid2}Neighbour checking of goals \textbf{f} and \textbf{b}.}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Forcing an Order }
Secondly, after scoring the goals according to their neighbours, the algorithm creates an $n \times n$ size matrix, where $n$ is the number of goals.
Each column of the matrix will represent a goal cell and the first row holds the ordering scores that were computed in the first step.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \caption{\label{tab:example_matrix}\centering Example level - Ordering matrix \break Incomplete (left) \& Complete (right)}
	\begin{minipage}{.5\linewidth}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{@{}lllll@{}}
		\toprule
		\textbf{f} & \textbf{e} & \textbf{b} & \textbf{c} & \textbf{a} \\ \midrule
		3          & 2          & 2          & 2          & 1          \\
		-          & -          & -          & -          & -          \\

		-          & -          & -          & -          & -          \\
		-          & -          & -          & -          & -          \\ \bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
  \end{minipage}%
  \begin{minipage}{.5\linewidth}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{@{}lllll@{}}
		\toprule
		\textbf{f} & \textbf{e} & \textbf{b} & \textbf{c} & \textbf{a} \\ \midrule
		3          & 2          & 2          & 2          & 1          \\
		4          & 3          & 3          & 2          & 1          \\
		5          & 3          & 3          & 2          & 1          \\
		6          & 4          & 3          & 2          & 1          \\ \midrule
		\textbf{7} & \textbf{4} & \textbf{3} & \textbf{2} & \textbf{1} \\ \bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
  \end{minipage}
\end{table}

The initial state of the matrix is presented in \cref{tab:example_matrix} (left).
From this matrix we see the first ordering scores being filled out while the rest remain to be computed.
The remaining rows are inspected and for every element in each row, the corresponding goal's score is incremented if one of the following criteria are satisfied:
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item the score is equal the max value in the row
  \item the score is less than the previous and next
  \item the score is less than the previous and equal to then next
  \item the score is equal to the previous and next
\end{enumerate}
%
For each iteration for each row, the value of the goal being inspected is taken from the previous row.
When we refer to ``the previous score'' it is the score of the goal to the left of the current goal being inspected (in the current row).
Moreover, ``the next score'' refers to the score of the goal to the right of the goal being inspected (in the previous row).
For instance, consider goal \textbf{e} at the first iteration (after the initial scoring) where the goal \textbf{f} already has been incremented because it was the max value in the previous row.
The previous goal's score is the score of \textbf{f} which is 4 (the current row).
The next goal's score is the score of \textbf{b} which is 2 (the previous row).
The score of \textbf{e} is incremented because it satisfies the third criteria.
The algorithm of course makes sure to only compare goals that are grouped together.
%
%If we define this in a more mathematical fashion, we can define a score as $s_{c}^{r}$, where $c$ defines the column, and $r$ defines the row of the given score.
%Moreover, let us define $e_r$ to be the scores in row $r$.
%Now, the criteria are as follows:
%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item $s_c^r = \max(e_r)$
%  \item $s_c^r < s_{c-1}^{r+1}$ and $s_{c}^{r} < s_{c+1}^r$  
%  \item $s_c^r < s_{c-1}^{r+1}$ and $s_c^r = s_{c+1}^r$
%  \item $s_c^r = s_{c-1}^{r+1}$ and $s_c^r = s_{c+1}^r$
%\end{enumerate}

The reason for incrementing the max score, throughout all iterations, is to account for multiple groups of goals, for which we want to score the openings similarly.
The idea is that we force an order on grouped goals so that we never have ambiguous priorities for neighbouring goals.
Thus, the client should never be in doubt of which goal to choose.
If two goals end up with the same score, they will either be a part of independently grouped goals, or equally accessible.

\subsubsection{Sorting the Goals}
Lastly, after the matrix has been computed as presented in \cref{tab:example_matrix} (right), the last row will contain the ordering of the goals.
These can then be used to order the goals in ascending order (from lowest to highest).
In our example case, the goals will be filled from \textbf{a} to \textbf{f}, respectively.
The performance benefits and pitfalls of this prioritisation algorithm, will be discussed in detail in \cref{subsec:disc_goal_ordering}.
%
% In levels where goals are grouped independently of other goal groups, the algorithm will allow for some scores to be the same.
% This signals that some goals can be achieved in an arbitrary order without one having to be filled before the other.
% The last row of the matrix in \cref{tab:example_matrix} (right), is now used to order the goals.
