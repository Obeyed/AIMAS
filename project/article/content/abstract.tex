%  \emph{A short summary of the paper and its main results/insights. Should preferably be less than 150 words.}
This paper presents a single-agent online centralised multibody planner.
We present and illustrate our goal prioritisation technique, which is our original contribution.
Furthermore, the simplicity of our client has proven to yield sub-optimal solutions, but with a high performance w.r.t. time spent to find and solve the given levels.
