\subsection{Online and Offline Planning}

Unable to look into the future because we solve sub-goals and don't build a plan for solving the entire level.

Offline planning is applicable for this domain because it is deterministic, static and fully observable.

Biggest challenge for offline planning is the combinatorial explosion/branching factor for planning for all possible contingencies for an entire plan.

More naturally online planning (and replanning) aims to achieve sub-goals that will eventually lead to a solution to the grand goal.

Furthermore, with online planning the client can plan for unseen future effects of past actions.
Note, we assumed that the domain was deterministic and fully observable for offline planning to be applicable.
By monitoring the execution of actions the client can keep and updated perception of the world in which the agents are performing actions.
