Our goal prioritisation technique is an original contribution, however we have found papers that also use prioritised planning.
For instance, \cite{van2005prioritized,bennewitz2001optimizing,erdmann1987multiple} present planning techniques where multiple objects must be moved, and the movement plans are constructed by prioritising either the paths or the objects to be moved.
This differs from our goal priotization in that they consider the object or the path, while we consider in which order to fulfill a goal.
Furthermore, prioritised planning is not a new concept.
Both in real life and in games plans must be prioritised, e.g. to stay alive in a game, the player or the game's AI agent must prioritise fleeing from danger or advancing on an enemy.~\cite{orkin2006three}
