Our goal prioritization technique is an original contribution, however we have found papers that also use prioritized planning.
For instance, \cite{van2005prioritized,bennewitz2001optimizing,erdmann1987multiple} present planning techniques where multiple objects must be moved, and the movement plans are costructed by prioritizing either the paths or the objects to be moved.
This differs from our goal priotization in that they consider the object or the path, while we consider in which order to fulfill a goal.
Furthermore, prioritized planning is not a new concept.
Both in real life and in games plans must be prioritized, e.g. to stay alive in a game, the player or the game's AI agent must prioritize fleeing from danger or advancing on an enemy.~\cite{orkin2006three}
