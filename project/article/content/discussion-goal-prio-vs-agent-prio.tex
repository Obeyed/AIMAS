We decided to do goal prioritisation over agent prioritisation because we wanted to solve the inner most goals if goals would block for each other.
Our goal prioritisation makes sure that we in most cases do not solve a goal if it will block for a unsolved goal.
If we had prioritisation on agents we could have gotten shorter solutions in some levels where an agent start close to a box and goal but it chooses another goal that is further away because that goal has a higher priority.
Our solution gives us less conflicts and less moving of boxes on solve goals.
