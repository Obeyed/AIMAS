Our first plan was to make a partial-order planner for multiple agents on an atomic level.
Knoblock examined how a partial-order planner would be able to construct parallel plans~\cite{knoblock1994generating}.

Ephrati had a similar approach to ours in 1994 where they suggested multi-agent planning with heuristics~\cite{ephrati1994divide}.
They divided the goal in sub-goals and made sub-plans that were merged to a global plan.
Their results showed that dividing into sub-goals and making the agents work in parallel can reduce the total elapsed time for the actual planning.
Similarly, we used a high-level planner to divide goals into independent sub-goals and solve them independently.

%\emph{Has this been done before? What is the closest related research? How does your work differ? Related work is sometimes integrated into the introduction or background, and sometimes it is made a separate section towards the end of the paper.  To make the related work section, you will be required to do some literature search to see if you can find papers that use similar methods (or combinations of methods) on similar types of problems. A piece of related work could for instance be if someone wrote a paper on using similar methods for the Sokoban domain. Sometimes it can be hard to find related work, but you should do your best. Use e.g. Google and Google Scholar (if a certain relevant paper is licensed, try to download it via findit.dtu.dk).}
