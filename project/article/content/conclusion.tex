\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

From our results, we can see that we have succesfully developed a single-agent online multibody planner.
In terms of success rate, it was able to solve 16 of 30 solvable levels, two of which our client was the only one to solve.
According to the course's competition results, our client was superior w.r.t. performance (the competition's time category) compared to the other group's clients.

To the best of our knowledge, our goal prioritisation technique is an original contribution to the project solution. 
It proved very effective at prioritising the goals in the correct order, making the client able to avoid blocking of goal cells and reduce the amount of actions taken.

The centralised planning we implemented made us able to reduce the complexity of the multi-agent levels, by removing the risk of conflicts caused by agents bumping into one another.
This along with the online planning approach drastically reduced the time needed for our client to compute a solution, but increased the number of actions performed because only one agent moves at a time.
