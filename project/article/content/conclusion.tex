\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have developed a single-agent online multibody planner.
It was able to solve 16 of 30 solvable levels, two of which our client was the only to solve.
According to the course's competition results, our client was superior w.r.t. performance (the competition's time category) compared to the other group's clients.
Our goal prioritization technique was a unique contribution to the project solution. 
It proved very effective at prioritizing the goals in the correct order, making us able to avoid blocking of goal cells and reduce the amount of actions taken.
The centralized planning we implemented made us able to reduce the complexity of the multi agent levels, by removing the chance of conflicts by agents bumping into one another.
This along with the online planning approach made our solution extremely time efficient, but increased our solution length by a bit.
