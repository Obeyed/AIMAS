It would be worth the effort to attempt to change the client to handle moving multiple agents simultaneously.
This would lower the number of actions performed.
If we consider having 10 agents working together instead of a single agent, then we could potentially have an order of magnitude less number of actions performed depending on the level.
The client could be modified to not only achieve goals in a specified order, but also check if any goals can be achieved in the same order, and if multiple agents could move simultanouesly to achieve these goals.
If it is not possible for more than one goal to be achieved simultaneously, then it might be possible for the waiting agents to move their respective boxes closer to the wanted goals.
It would of course only be moved in such a manner that it would not block a path to the other goals.
Moreover, moving multiple agents simultaneuosly would also require us to handle live-lock situations.
