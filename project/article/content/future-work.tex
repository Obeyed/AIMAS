\subsection{Future Work}
\label{sec:future work}

%\emph{What are the most immediate possible extensions or generalisations of your work? How would you develop it further if you had more time? Does your method generalise to other types of domain? If not, what would be required for it to do so? Sometimes it makes most sense to integrate discussion and future work into a single section. Future work should focus on immediate extensions that you more or less would know how to implement, it shouldnâ€™t be very speculative extensions that are not even quite clear to yourself.}

A way to establish \textit{safe zones} for the different agents to place boxes, could be to use our goal prioritisation algorithm on free cells instead of goals.
This could be achieved by mapping all the cells that are not in direct paths towards the goals, and score them according to the number of neighbouring free cells.
With some adjustment to the scoring algorithm, this could prove to be a simple way of detecting safe zones (or buffer areas) for agents and boxes to move freely, without blocking the way of others.
